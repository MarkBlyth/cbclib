GOAL: scripts for continuing periodic orbits in a controlled system.
   * Allows different systems

   * SHOULD allow different numerical solvers, especially surrogate-based solvers
   * DOES NOT allow different augmentations, eg. to track folds

TODOs
   * Make a separate solvers package, with Newton, Broyden, SciPy, (adaptive Newton?); different convergence criteria; different Jacobian estimations; so that solvers can be easily mixed and matched.
   * Add f_eval, n_fev, and other interesting solver data into its return (maybe make a solver solution class?)
   * Store all the nice solver data in the ContinuationSolution
   * Move Continuation class, collocation classes into a separate Continuation Core package
     * Have this as a continuation-runners class (for numerical, cbc, eventually EPC)

            continuation_target : function(control target, system parameter)
                Something resembling a physical system. Given only a
                control target and a system parameter, it returns a signal
                of form [[signal ts], [signal ys]]. The exact method for
                doing this is left to the system implementer. It is
                suggested that the system uses the previous run's
                end-state as the initial conditions for the next run; that
                the system integrates out and omits all transients; that
                the system ensures a sufficiently long integration time to
                fully represent the signal, eg. sufficient periods.
